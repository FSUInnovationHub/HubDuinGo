## How to Contribute

First you need to get the code for this repository.  First you need to make sure
you have [`git`][git-about] [installed][git-install].  In short,
[`git`][git-about] is a tool often used by software developers to keep track of
changes to their code and work more seamlessly with other developers!  Install
it on your computer [here][git-install].

First, make a [fork][github-fork] by clicking the button at the top.  This makes
a copy of this project on your profile where you will put your changes.

### Editing through GitHub

On your [fork][github-fork], in the file list click a file that you want to edit
and click the pencil icon to open an online editor that you can use to change
the file.  Once you are ready to commit your file, go down to the bottom and
leave a descriptive message and summary for your changes and click the green
"commit" button and follow the instructions below.

### Editing on your Computer

To get the code onto your computer so you can edit it, [clone][github-clone] the
repository by clicking the green "clone or download" button and copying the link.

Open a terminal on your computer, `cd` into the folder that will contain
HuDuinGo's code, and type:

```
$ git clone [link]
```

Where `[Link]` is the link you copied above.  Now you can open the files in your
favorite editor and make any changes you want and [`add`][git-add] and then
[`commit`][git-commit] them to your history, then [`push`][git-push] them to
your repository.

### Getting your Changes approved and added to the project

Once the changes appear on your [fork][github-fork] and you are ready to send
them to the official project, make a [pull request][github-pr] on the
[official repository][hubduingo-pr] and click the "compare across forks"
button.  Select your fork as the "compare" option and HubDuinGo's `master`
branch as the "base" option.

This will open a new [pull request][github-pr]!  Describe your changes in detail
and one of our staff will review the change, leave a review accepting or
rejecting it's changes, and load the new code onto HubDuinGo!
